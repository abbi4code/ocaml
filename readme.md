Write a program in OCaml that reads a text file (or from the terminal). For each line of input, extract any contiguous integers into a list. Emit the list. Sum the list. Emit the sum Finally, emit the sum of all of the numbers. Example input:
–
sq: RV128 only, not RV64 nor RV32
lr (? Figure A.13, part 2)

jalr: broken 2 times
–
Example output (format may differ):
–
128 + 64 + 32 = 224
13 + 2 = 15
= 0
2 = 2
224 + 15 + 0 + 2 = 241
